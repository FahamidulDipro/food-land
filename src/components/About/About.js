            <p>
            Home cooks are our heroes; it's as simple as that. Food Land is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate two days to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a rich weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without spending the whole evening shuffling dishes in and out of the oven.
